You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: GSM4672359: ChIP-seq H3K27ac in human aortic valve interstitial cells (input);  ChIP-Seq. ChipSeq H3K27ac input S11
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: Super-Enhancer-Associated Aortic Valve Stenosis Risk Locus 1p21.2 Alters NFATC2 Binding Site and Promotes Fibrogenesis [ChIP-Seq]
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Genome-wide association studies identified a strong signal for non coding variants at the 1p21.2 locus associated with calcific aortic valve stenosis (CAVS). Regulation at the locus and impact on the biology of the aortic valve is presently unknown. Integrative mapping of genetic association data was performed. The locus was evaluated by 3D genome mapping, analysis of atomic resolution data, DNA-binding assay and CRISPR activation (CRISPRa). Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was performed to determine regulatory network in CAVS. The functional impact of the locus was assessed in isolated VICs. Fine-grained mapping at 1p21.2 risk locus identified rs6702619 as being located in open chromatin and a distant-acting super-enhancer including chromatin interaction with the promoter of PALMD in VICs. Atomic-level data showed that the risk variant modified base readout and DNA shape, which prevented the recruitment of NFATC2, a transcription factor involved in heart valve morphogenesis, and lowered the expression of PALMD. CRISPRa confirmed that rs6702619 exerts a control on the expression of PALMD. WGCNA performed in 233 calcified aortic valves identified a co-expression network encompassing PALMD, which was enriched in actin-based process. In LC-MS/MS and co-immunoprecipitation assay, actin was identified as a protein interacting with PALMD. Lower expression of PALMD in VICs promoted the polymerization of actin, the activation of myocardin-related transcription factor and fibrogenesis. Risk allele at rs6702619 disrupts a NFATC2 binding site and decreases enhancer-mediated expression of PALMD, which results in actin polymerization, a myofibroblast-like phenotype in VICs and fibrogenesis, a key underpinning process in the pathogenesis of CAVS. Overall design: ChIP-seq (H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K27ac) in human aortic valve interstitial cells
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Human aortic valve interstitial cells were isolated from control non-mineralized aortic valves obtained from patients undergoing heart transplantation. The protocol was approved by the local ethical committee and informed consent was obtained from the subjects. Aortic leaflets were cut into pieces and incubated in 0.3% type I collagenase (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ON, Canada) at 37°C for 45 minutes, then filtered through a 70 µm mesh, centrifuged for 5 minutes at 1,500 rpm and resuspended in complete media (DMEM, 10% FBS with L-glutamine and sodium pyruvate). Cells were used between passages 3 to 7. Nuclear extracts from VICs were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against H3K4me3, H3K4me1 (Cell Signaling Technology, New England Biolabs, ON, Canada) or H3K27Ac (Abcam, ON, Canada) pre-bound to protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, ON, Canada). DNA was purified using DNA clean up & concentrator kit (Zymo Research, Cedarlane, Canada). Libraries were constructed using the QIAseq Ultralow Input Library Kit (Qiagen, ON, Canada) according to manufacturer's instructions. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq4000 (UCSD IGM Genomics Facility, CA, USA)
