You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: CA0AMACXX 8W DRB TAS 17s000571-1-1 Fousteri lane18. GSM3564719: RNAPII-hypo NO UV +DRB X4h;  ChIP-Seq
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: Continuous transcription initiation guarantees robust repair of all transcribed genes and regulatory regions
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Inhibition of transcription caused by DNA damage-impaired RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation conceals a local increase in de novo transcription, slowly progressing from Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) to gene ends. Although associated with accelerated repair of Pol II-encountered lesions and limited mutagenesis, it is still unclear how this mechanism is maintained during genotoxic stress-recovery. Here we uncover a widespread gain in chromatin accessibility and preservation of the active H3K27ac mark after UV-irradiation. The concomitant increase in Pol II escape from promoter-proximal pause (PPP) sites of most active genes, PROMPTs and enhancer RNAs favors unrestrained initiation, as evidenced by the synthesis of nascent RNAs including start RNAs. Accordingly, drug-inhibition of PPP-release replenishes levels of pre-initiating Pol II at TSSs after UV. Our data show that such continuous engagement of Pol II molecules ensures maximal transcription-driven repair throughout expressed genes and regulatory loci. Importantly, revealing this unanticipated regulatory layer of UV-response provides physiological relevant traction to the emerging concept that Pol II initiation rate is determined by pause-release dynamics. Overall design: ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq experiments were performed in human VH10 cells before and following DNA damage induced by low doses (15 or 20 J/m2) of UV-C irradiation. Inhibitor of transcription DRB was used as indicated in the protocols section
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). RNAPII-hypo NO UV / +DRB / X 4h. VH10 cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37 C and 5% CO2. VH10 cells were irradiated with  UV-C as previously described (Lavigne et al., Nature Communications, 2017). Specifically, we monitored changes occuring during reccovery from DNA damage for Chromatin accessibility (ATAC-seq) (NO UV and 2 h after 15 J/m2), chromatin modifications (H3K27ac (NO UV and 2 h after 15 J/m2) and H3K27me3 (NO UV and 2 h after 20J /m2)) and transcriptional changes (RNA polymerase II hypophosphorylated (NO UV or 15 J/m2). When the inhibitor of transcription DRB was used it was during recovery to inhibit release of RNA polymerases from promoter-proximal regions and to monitor the accumulation of RNAPII-hypo at TSSs. For ATAC-seq method, nuclei preparation and transposition and amplification of transposed fragments for library preparation was performed as described in Corces et al, 2017 with minor modifications; (i) 70,000 cells were used per experimental condition and (ii) The DNase treatment of cells in culture medium, before the transposition reaction, was skipped. For ChIP-seq, lysates were clarified from sonicated nuclei and chromatin (in the range of 150-400 bp) was isolated and precipitated with  anti-RNAPII-CTD-hypo (8WG16; 05-952, lot: 2262610) from Millipore or anti-H3K27ac (ab4729, Abcam) or anti-H3K27me3 (07-449, Millipore). For ATAC-seq method, transposition and amplification of transposed fragments for library preparation was performed using Nextera DNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc) and primers as described in Corces et al., 2017. For ChIP-Seq, DNA libraries were generated by ligation adapters and amplification by LM-PCR (Truseq) or (NEBNext). Briefly, ChiPed or Input dsDNA was end-repaired using a combination of T4 DNA polymerase, E. coli DNA Pol I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynucleotide kinase as described previously (Lavigne et al., 2017). The blunt, phosphorylated ends were treated with Klenow fragment  and dATP to yield a protruding 3- 'A' base for ligation of Illumina's adapters which have a single 'T' base overhang at the 3' end. Alternatively, we used NEBnext and Truseq approaches to multiplex samples for sequencing different samples in a single lane of the flowcell. qPCR with Illumina primers was used to control for overamplification. The purified DNA library was size selected by AMpure beads purification as previously described and was typically in the range of 200 to 500 bp. In all cases, libraries were sequenced on Hiseq2000 or 2500 in Genecore, EMBL following manufacturer's protocols. double-stranded single-end DNA-seq was performed for ChIP-seq, Input-seq and ATAC-seq
