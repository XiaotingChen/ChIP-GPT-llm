You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name:  SAMD00125997. DRR137864. ATAC-seq RERF-LC-KJ 24h C03 10058-F4 10
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: Multi-omics characterization of drug perturbations in lung cancer cell lines
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): In this study, we constructed comprehensive transcriptome and epigenome catalogues of responses to various well-annotated compounds in 23 lung cancer cell lines. We selected 95 compounds including approved receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and epigenetic targeting drugs. To obtain profiles of transcriptome and epigenome changes by drug administration, we depeloved a high-throughtput sequencing platform of RNA-seq and ATAC-seq. We generated 3,240 RNA-seq and 3,393 ATAC-seq datasets from cells treated with the compounds. The data comprise two kinds of datasets: the datasets obtained from five cell lines treated with four concentrations of 23 selected compounds at three time points (24, 48, 72h) (dataset-1); and the datasets obtained from 23 cell lines treated with one concentration of 95 compounds for 24h (dataset-2). Furthermore, we integrated multi-omics information based on transcriptome modules and investigated whether the drugs could control transcriptome and epigenome patterns of the modules and finally regulate phenotypic responses such as cellular survival of lung cancers. Here we demonstrated multi-omics characterization of drug perturbations and module-based regulation of lung cancer cells
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). ATAC-seq library is constructed according to the original ATAC-seq protocol (Buenrostro et al. 2013) with some modifications

All of the information below should apply specifically to this particular sample:

Cell line info: RERF-LC-KJ
Other info of potential relevance: sample_name = {ATAC-seq_RERF-LC-KJ_24h_C03_10058-F4_10}; parsed primary ID = {DRX130602}; LIBRARYSELECTION = {other}; inferred sequence type = {ATAC}; bioproject_id = {PRJDB6952}; LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ATAC-seq}



0. RERF-LC-KJ
1. adenocarcinoma
2. lung
3. N/A
4. N/A (no genetic modifications are mentioned in the record )
5. No, the string "input" does not appear in the sample name "SAMD00125997. DRR137864. ATAC-seq RERF-LC-KJ 24h C03 10058-F4 10", and there is no indication that this sample is an input control
6. Yes, "RERF-LC-KJ" appears in the sample name
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. N/A
10. This sample is not a ChIP-seq sample; it is an ATAC-seq sample, as indicated by the sample name "SAMD00125997. DRR137864. ATAC-seq RERF-LC-KJ 24h C03 10058-F4 10", the study abstract, the protocol information, and library strategy ("LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ATAC-seq}")
11. N/A (this sample is not a ChIP-seq sample; it is an ATAC-seq sample.)
12. N/A (this sample is not a ChIP-seq sample; it is an ATAC-seq sample.)
13. No, it may be ATAC-seq (actually it *is* ATAC-seq for sure)
14. 95 compounds including approved receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors and epigenetic targeting drugs were used in this study. The sample name "SAMD00125997. DRR137864. ATAC-seq RERF-LC-KJ 24h C03 10058-F4 10" indicates that the sample was treated with compound C03 for 24 hours
15. C03 compound (concentration=N/A, duration=24_hours)
16. No, this sample does not correspond to a control genetic modification or control genetic background (in addition, no such controls are mentioned in the study abstract or protocol)
17. No: this sample was treated with a compound (C03), and there is no indication that this treatment was used as a control for another treatment
18. "Receptor tyrosine kinase"
19. No
