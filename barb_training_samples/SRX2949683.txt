You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: ChIP-seq anti-HBx HepaRG i01-PW1-april17-1 S1 all R1 001 cutadapt. GSM2680328: human hepatocytes (HepaRG) HBx;  ChIP-Seq
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: Episomal HBV persistence within transcribed host nuclear chromatin compartments involves HBx
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): In hepatocyte nuclei, hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes occur episomally as covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The HBV X protein (HBx) is required to initiate and maintain HBV replication and acts as host gene trans-regulator. However, functionally relevant spatiotemporal localization and interactions of cccDNA and HBx remain to be understood. This is the first study utilizing circularized chromosome conformation capture (4C) to identify regional virus-host genome interactions. We combined 4C with RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to illuminate the nuclear landscape associated with HBV episomes and HBx. Moreover, we functionally studied HBx-binding to episomal HBV DNA. In human HBV-positive HepaRG hepatocytes, 4C and ChIP revealed specific nuclear localization of HBV episomes and HBx associated with actively transcribed nuclear domains correlating well in size with constrained topological units built up by chromatin fibre loops, which are believed to constitute fundamental cell nuclear architectural units. Interestingly, HBx alone occupied transcribed chromatin domains, and its binding to HBV episomes depended on its C-terminus in vitro. In conclusion, HBx and HBV DNA similarly follow higher-order nuclear assembly patterns, specifically favoring transcriptionally active nuclear compartments. These novel observations may shed light on important unsolved problems: to understand the long-term episomal stability and the facilitation of viral persistence. Overall design: In different hepatocyte celltypes, the genomic/nuclear association was studied for NLS-HBx-RFP, and several histone H3 PTM and Pol2 (MMH-D3 cells) by ChIP-seq; also cccDNA contacts were studied by 4C-seq, and histone PTM, Pol2 and mRNA were studied by ChIP-seq or mRNA-seq, respectively (HepaRG cell and HepG2.2.15/HepG2 H1.3)
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Briefly, lysates from cells crosslinked for 10 min in 1% formaldehyde were layered onto a 1.6 M sucrose cushion (1.6 M sucrose in 60 mM, KCl 15 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 0.1 mM ethylene glycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 15 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5 mM DTT, 0.1 mM phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride (PMSF), 3.6 ng/mL aprotinin) and centrifuged. Nuclei were collected and portions corresponding to 50μg chromatin were sheared by ultrasonic treatment using a Bioruptor UCD-200 (Diagenode) and 30× [30 s ON/30 s OFF] at position ‘high’. Chromatin fragment size was controlled on agarose gels, and one of the chromatin aliquots was saved as input. For ChIP analyses, sheared chromatin samples were incubated with the respective antibody-of-interest in a rotator for 16 h at 4°C. Subsequently 20 μl protein G magnetic beads (Diagenode) were added and incubated for 4 hrs at 4°C rotating. Immunocomplexes attached to protein G magnetic beads were separated using a magnetic rack and washed repeatedly. To elute DNA fragments enriched by immunoprecipitation, immunocomplexes were incubated with elution buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris–HCl, (pH 8.1)) for 30 min at 65°C on a shaker. Eluted immunocomplexes were treated with proteinase K overnight at 55°C. Antibodies used for IP were directed against HBxAg (mouse monoclonal antibody, clone 3F6-G10; Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.), Pol2 (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, USA), H3K4me3 (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), H3K4me1 (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), H3K9me3 (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), H3K9ac (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), H3K27me3 (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), H3K27ac (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), H3K36me3 (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium) or H3K36ac (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium). DNA associated with enriched immunocomplexes was purified by phenol:chloroform:isoamylic alcohol extraction and precipitated with isopropylic alcohol. Illumina-compatible libraries were prepared using the MicroPlex Library Preparation kit v2 (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium). Massive parallel sequencing was performed as described below. ChIP-seq was performed with the paired-end or, alternatively, with the single read option (42nt paired-end in mmu experiments/50nt single-end in hsa experiments) and the Illumina NextSeq 500 High Output Kit
