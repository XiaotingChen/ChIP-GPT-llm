You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) is a biologically heterogeneous and clinically aggressive disease. Here, we explore the role of BET bromodomain proteins in DLBCL, using integrative chemical genetics and functional epigenomics. We observe highly asymmetric loading of BRD4 at enhancers, with approximately 33% of all BRD4 localizing to enhancers at 1.6% of occupied genes. These super-enhancers prove particularly sensitive to bromodomain inhibition, explaining the selective effect of BET inhibitors on oncogenic and lineage-specific transcriptional circuits. Functional study of genes marked by super-enhancers identifies DLBCLs dependent on OCA-B and suggests a strategy for discovering unrecognized cancer dependencies. Translational studies performed on a comprehensive panel of DLBCLs establish a therapeutic rationale for evaluating BET inhibitors in this disease. Overall design: ChIP-Seq for various transcription factors and histone modifications in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Whole cell extracts were sonicated to solubilize the chromatin. The chromatin extracts containing DNA fragments with an average size of 500 bp were immunoprecipitated using different antibodies. Purified immunoprecipitated DNA were prepared for sequencing according to a modified version of the Solexa Genomic DNA protocol. Fragmented DNA was end repaired and subjected to 18 cycles of LM-PCR using oligos provided by Illumina. Amplified fragments between 150 and 300bp (representing shear fragments between 50 and 200nt in length and ~100bp of primer sequence) were isolated by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified.

10. The ChIP target for this particular sample can be identified as H3K4ME3 from "Other antibody info: 07-473. H3K4me3. Millipore" in the sample-specific section of the record. The sample name "GSM1133648: LY1 H3K4ME3 DMSO; ChIP-Seq" further confirms this. The presence of "H3K4ME3" in the sample name refers to the trimethylation of lysine 4 on histone 3, which is the target for this ChIP-seq experiment

14. The treatment information can be identified from the sample name "GSM1133648: LY1 H3K4ME3 DMSO; ChIP-Seq" and the record entry "Treatment info: DMSO". The sample was treated with DMSO for 24 hours as noted in the "Other info of potential relevance" section. But this is not a notable treatment, in that it is just a control for JQ1 treatment
