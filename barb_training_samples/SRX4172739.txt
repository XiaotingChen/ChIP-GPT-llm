You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Despite advances in the detection and management of colorectal cancers, resistance to anti-cancer therapies remains a significant challenge. Activating mutations in KRAS and BRAF are frequently observed in colorectal cancers and have been associated with aggressive tumors and poor survival after chemotherapy. In the present study, we demonstrate that mutations in KRAS/BRAF alter the enhancer landscape of tumor cells, which leads to the resistance of the cornerstone colorectal cancer chemotherapeutic agent 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) through activation of transcription factor GATA1. Targeted inhibition of GATA1 reverses epigenetic changes in KRAS mutant cells and restores sensitivity to 5-FU. These results indicate a novel therapeutic opportunity for tailoring individualized therapy in human colorectal cancer. Overall design: RNA-seq and H3K4me1- H3K27ac-ChIP-seq were performed on GATA1 KO HCT116 cells. RNA-seq was performed on K7174-treated HCT116 cells and Colo320 cells expressing vector, wildtype and G12V KRAS
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). The total RNA was extract using QIAGEN RNeasy Mini Kit. 5x106 active growing cultured cells were harvest, suspended in 10ml PBS, and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde (final concentration) for 10 min, and quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature, and washed twice with PBS. The pellets were resuspended in 100 μl cell lysis buffer (1% Triton-X, 0.1% Sodium-Deoxycholate, proteinase inhibitor, TE) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Lysates were diluted with 900 ul TE, and sonicated for 15 min (30 sec on / 30 sec off) using Bioruptor pico (Diagenode, Inc., Denville, NJ), and centrifuged at top speed for 10 min. The supernants were collected and the chromatin content was estimated by the Qubit assay (Invitrogen). The chromatin was then incubated with 2.5 μg of rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K27ac antibody (Abcam, D5E4, 1:5000) on a rocker overnight. Protein G-magnetic beads (30 μL, Invitrogen) were added for 4 hours incubation. The bedads were entensively washed with ChIP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), high salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1, 10 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 0.25 M LiCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA), and TE buffer. Bound chromatin was eluted and reverse-crosslinked at 65 °C overnight. DNAs were purified using Min-Elute purification kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) after the treatment of RNase A and proteinase K. RNA library preparation and sequence were done through Novogene. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from ChIP DNA using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit (NEB). The ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced to 50 base pairs on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 using pair-end mode in the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine Medical Genome Facility
