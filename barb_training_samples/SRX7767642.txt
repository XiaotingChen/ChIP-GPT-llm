You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: GSM4330939: PT1 GATA2 Veh ChIP Input;  ChIP-Seq. 387ControlInput S4
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: GATA2 and progesterone receptor interaction in endometrial stromal cells undergoing decidualization [ChIP-Seq]
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): The zinc-finger transcription factor GATA2 has been shown to be important for endometrial stromal cell decidualization in early pregnancy in mice and humans. Progesterone and its receptor PGR is also critical during decidualization but its interaction with GATA2 in regulating genes and pathways necessary for decidualization in human endometrium are unclear. Human endometrial stromal cells were isolated from 5 premenopausal women for primary cell culture. The cells underwent in vitro decidualization (IVD) or vehicle (Veh) treatment for 10 days. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to compare gene expression profiles (n=3) and chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) using an antibody against GATA2 (n=2) was performed to examine binding to target genes in the Veh and IVD cells. A public PGR ChIP-seq dataset (GSE69539) was mined to identify PGR-binding regions in IVD-treated human endometrial cells. Overall design: Genome-wide GATA2 binding profiling in human endometrial stromal cells with and without IVD treatment using ChIP-Seq
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Chromatin input from PT1_GATA2_Veh_ChIP sample. DMEM/F12 w/ 10% FBS and 1x antibiotic/antimycotic. 10 day treatment. IVD treatment: 1 µM MPA, 35nM ß-estradiol, 0.05 mM 8-bromo cAMP; Vehicle treatment: equal volume ethanol. 7.5e8 cells (patient number = 2) were used for ChIP-Seq using the SimpleChIP Kit (Cell Signaling Technology, #9005). GATA2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (#sc-9008). Next-generation sequencing libraries were prepared using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK8502) and KAPA Single-Indexed Adapter Kit (KAPA Biosystems, KK8710)

All of the information below should apply specifically to this particular sample:

Antibody info:none
Tissue info: Primary endometrial stromal cells. Isolated stromal cells post-hysterectomy
Other info of potential relevance: parsed primary ID = {SRX7767642}; LIBRARYSELECTION = {ChIP}; molecule-type = {genomic DNA}; parsed_GSM_ID = {GSM4330939}; inferred sequence type = {ChIPSeq}; LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ChIP-Seq}; patient id = {Patient 1}; sample-type = {SRA}

Barb's answers are as follows:
0. Primary
1. Endometrial stromal cells
2. Uterus (inferred by Barb)
3. Endometrium
4. N/A (no genetic modifications are mentioned)
5. Yes, the string "input" appears in the sample name "GSM4330939: PT1 GATA2 Veh ChIP Input;  ChIP-Seq. 387ControlInput S4". Yes, the sample is an input control
6. No, the cell name or an obvious abbreviation does not appear in the sample name "GSM4330939: PT1 GATA2 Veh ChIP Input;  ChIP-Seq. 387ControlInput S4"
7. GATA2 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz (#sc-9008)
8. manufacturer=santa_cruz,clone=N/A,catalog=sc-9008,lot=N/A,target=GATA2
9. GATA2, PGR (progesterone receptor)
10. "Antibody info:none" in the sample-specific section of the record means that no antibody was applied to this sample, which would identify the sample as an input control. The sample name "GSM4330939: PT1 GATA2 Veh ChIP Input;  ChIP-Seq. 387ControlInput S4" indicates that the ChIP target for the study as a whole is GATA2, and the protocol information does mention a GATA2 antibody (Santa Cruz, #sc-9008). But, importantly, the sample name also contains "input", meaning that the sample name also supports the inference that the sample is an input control. Overall, the sample is an input control
11. Input
12. N/A (input control)
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. The sample name "GSM4330939: PT1 GATA2 Veh ChIP Input;  ChIP-Seq. 387ControlInput S4" indicates that the sample was treated with vehicle (Veh) as part of the ChIP-seq experiment. This is just a control treatment, which is not to be reported as a treatment of interest
15. N/A
16. No, this sample does not correspond to a control genetic modification or control genetic background
17. Yes, this sample corresponds to a control treatment (Veh) for comparison with the IVD treatment (MPA, ß-estradiol, 8-bromo cAMP)
18. "Decidualization"
19. No
