You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Performing ChIP-seq analyses in clinical specimens has remained largely challenging due to multiple technical limitations and low quantities of starting material, resulting in low enrichments and poor signal-to-noise ratio. Here, we refined the original protocols for transcription factor ChIP-seq analyses in breast, prostate, and endometrial tumor tissue. In addition to the standard fixative formaldehyde, a second crosslinker Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) was included in the procedure. Overall design: AR, FOXA1, ERa, H3K27ac & H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data with and without double croslinking in celllines (LNCAP & MCF-7) and in human tissues (Prostate, Breast, Endometrium and Prostate samples from core needle biopsies)
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Chromatin immunoprecipitations were performed as described previously with minor changes (Zwart et al., 2013). Samples were crosslinked in solution A with 2mM DSG (CovaChem) for 25 minutes at room temperature. After 25 minutes, 1% formaldehyde was added for 20 minutes and subsequently quenched with glycine. Samples were lysed as described (Schmidt et al., 2009) and sonicated for at least 10 cycles of 30s on, 30s off using a Diagenode Bioruptor Pico. For each ChIP, 5ug of antibody was conjugated with 50ul Protein A magnetic beads. Antibodies used were AR (sc-816, Santa Cruz), H3K27ac (39133, Active Motif), H3K4me3 (Ab8580, Abcam) and H3K27me3 (39155, Active Motif). Immunoprecipitated DNA was processed for library preparation (Part# 0801-0303, KAPA biosystems kit). Immunoprecipitated DNA was processed for library preparation (Part# 0801-0303, KAPA biosystems kit). Surgical resections from Prostate, breast and endometrium tumors. fresh frozen material

All of the information below should apply specifically to this particular sample:

Antibody info:AR (Santa Cruz; sc-816)
Tissue info: primary prostate cancer
Other info of potential relevance: parsed primary ID = {SRX4116020}; LIBRARYSELECTION = {ChIP}; molecule-type = {genomic DNA}; parsed_GSM_ID = {GSM3149057}; inferred sequence type = {ChIPSeq}; case/control = {DSG}; LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ChIP-Seq}; patient id = {P4_AR_DSG}; sample-type = {SRA}


0. primary tumor
1. prostate cancer
2. prostate
3. N/A
4. N/A
5. No, "input" does not appear in the sample name "P4 AR DSG.bam. GSM3149057: P4 AR DSG;  ChIP-Seq" and the sample is not an input control.
6. Unsure; "P4" may be a reference to the patient who donated the primary tumor
7. AR (sc-816, Santa Cruz), H3K27ac (39133, Active Motif), H3K4me3 (Ab8580, Abcam) and H3K27me3 (39155, Active Motif)
8. manufacturer=santa_cruz,clone=N/A,catalog=sc-816,lot=N/A,target=AR; manufacturer=active_motif,clone=N/A,catalog=39133,lot=N/A,target=H3K27ac; manufacturer=abcam,clone=N/A,catalog=Ab8580,lot=N/A,target=H3K4me3; manufacturer=active_motif,clone=N/A,catalog=39155,lot=N/A,target=H3K27me3
9. AR, FOXA1, ERa
10. The "Antibody info" in the sample-specific section designates AR (Androgen Receptor) as the immunoprecipitation target, consistent with "AR" in the sample name "P4 AR DSG". The presence of "DSG" in the sample name refers to the use of Disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) as a crosslinker in the ChIP experiment
11. AR
12. AR
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. No specific treatments are mentioned for this particular sample (other than the use of the DSG crosslinker, which has to do with the ChIP procedure and is thus irrelevant here)
15. N/A
16. No
17. No
18. Androgen receptor signaling pathway, Prostate cancer progression
19. No
