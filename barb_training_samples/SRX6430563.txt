You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Upon EZH2 inhibitor treatment, PRC2 components EZH2 and SUZ12 are redistributed across the genome towards a small number of genomic loci that are refractory to H3K27me3 loss. Focal PRC2 accumulation and H3K27me3 retention occur primarily at CpG islands and transcription start sites of genes, with enrichment at canonical PRC2 nucleation sites. EZH2 and SUZ12 are present at low levels at actively transcribed TSSs, and this signal is lost with EZH2 inhibition. Overall design: ChIP-seq of PRC2 components, H3K27me3, and H3K4me3 upon treatment with EZH2 inhibitor or a control, in DLBCL and multiple myeloma cell lines
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). KARPAS-422 cells were treated for 4 and 8 days with 1.5 Î¼M of CPI-360. SUDHL6 cells were treated for 4 days with 1.5uM of Compound 1. KMS28BM and KMS28PE cells were treated for 4 days with 1.5uM of CPI360. RL cells were treated for 10 days with 5uM of CPI169. KARPAS-422 cell line was grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). SUDHL6 cell lines were grown in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI) GlutaMAX medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen). For ChIP-seq, cells were pelleted, fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 mins, lysed and sonicated. Chromatin samples were precleared with Protein A Dynabeads (Life Technologies), and incubated overnight at 40C with anti-EZH2 (Millipore 07-689), anti-H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling Techonology 9730), anti-SUZ12 (Active Motif 39357), and anti-H3K4me3 (Abcam ab8580). Chromatin-antibody complexes were precipitated using Protein A Dynabeads followed by washes in RIPA buffer and Tris/ EDTA. Samples were digested with RNAase A, treated with Proteinase K and 10% SDS, followed by cross-link reversal at 650C. DNA was purified using MinElute PCR purification kits (Qiagen). DNA libraries for ChIP-seq were prepared using Ovation Ultralow DR Multiplex System kits (0330-32, NuGEN) followed by Illumina sequencing

All of the information below should apply specifically to this particular sample:

Antibody target: Suz12
Other antibody info: Suz12. Active Motif 39357
Treatment info: 1.5uM CPI360 8 days
Tissue info: Diffuse large B cell lymphoma
Cell line info: KARPAS-422
Other info of potential relevance: parsed primary ID = {SRX6430563}; LIBRARYSELECTION = {ChIP}; molecule-type = {genomic DNA}; parsed_GSM_ID = {GSM3937782}; inferred sequence type = {ChIPSeq}; LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ChIP-Seq}; sample-type = {SRA}


Barb's answers are as follows:
0. KARPAS-422
1. Diffuse large B cell lymphoma
2. Lymph node
3. N/A
4. No genetic modifications were introduced for this particular sample
5. No, "input" does not appear in "GSM3937782: KARPAS-422 1.5uM CPI360 8 days Suz12 ChIP-seq;  ChIP-Seq. 21 2264CP KARPAS-422 EZH2i 8d Suz12 i86 filtered". The sample is not an input control.
6. Yes, "KARPAS-422" appears in the sample name "GSM3937782: KARPAS-422 1.5uM CPI360 8 days Suz12 ChIP-seq;  ChIP-Seq. 21 2264CP KARPAS-422 EZH2i 8d Suz12 i86 filtered"
7. anti-EZH2 (Millipore 07-689), anti-H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling Techonology 9730), anti-SUZ12 (Active Motif 39357), and anti-H3K4me3 (Abcam ab8580)
8. manufacturer=Millipore,clone=N/A,catalog=07-689,lot=N/A,target=EZH2; manufacturer=cell_signaling_technology,clone=N/A,catalog=9730,lot=N/A,target=H3K27me3; manufacturer=active_motif,clone=N/A,catalog=39357,lot=N/A,target=SUZ12; manufacturer=abcam,clone=N/A,catalog=ab8580,lot=N/A,target=H3K4me3
9. EZH2, SUZ12, PRC2 (Barb knows this is a protein complex rather than a single gene; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2)
10. Both the "Antibody target" "Other antibody info" fields in the sample-specific section identify Suz12 as the target. The sample name "GSM3937782: KARPAS-422 1.5uM CPI360 8 days Suz12 ChIP-seq;  ChIP-Seq. 21 2264CP KARPAS-422 EZH2i 8d Suz12 i86 filtered" also contains "Suz12" and not "input". Therefore the target is Suz12
11. Suz12
12. SUZ12
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. The treatment information is provided in the "Treatment info: 1.5uM CPI360 8 days" section. The sample was treated with 1.5uM CPI360 for 8 days. CPI is an EZH2 inhibitor
15. CPI360 (concentration=1.5uM, duration=8_days, details=EZH2_inhibitor)
16. No
17. No
18. "Response to EZH2 inhibitor treatment",  "Cell cycle regulation", "Regulation of DNA replication", "Regulation of cell proliferation", "Regulation of apoptosis", "Regulation of cellular response to DNA damage", "Regulation of cellular response to genotoxic stress", "Regulation of chromatin silencing" (these terms are inferred by Barb based on her knowledge of EZH@ and PRC2, even if not directly mentioned in the record; EZH2 and PRC2 have been implicated in various cellular responses, including the response to genotoxic stress and DNA damage)
19. Yes (DNA damage)
