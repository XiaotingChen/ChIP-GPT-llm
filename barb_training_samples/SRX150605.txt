You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: hg19 wgEncodeSydhTfbsGm12891NfkbTnfaIggrabRawData. GSM935526: Stanford ChipSeq GM12891 TNFa NFKB IgG-rab
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: GSE31477: ENCODE Transcription Factor Binding Sites by ChIP-seq from Stanford/Yale/USC/Harvard
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Summary:       This track shows probable binding sites of the specified transcription factors (TFs) in the given cell types as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing (ChIP-Seq). Included for each cell type is the input signal, which represents the control condition where no antibody targeting was performed. For each experiment (cell type vs. antibody) this track shows a graph of enrichment for TF binding (Signal), along with sites that have the greatest evidence of transcription factor binding (Peaks).    For data usage terms and conditions, please refer to  and   Overall Design: Cells were grown according to the approved ENCODE cell culture protocols. Further preparations were similar to those previously published (Euskirchen et al., 2007) with the exceptions that the cells were unstimulated and sodium orthovanadate was omitted from the buffers. For details on the chromatin immunoprecipitation protocol used, see Euskirchen et al. (2007) and Rozowsky et al. (2009).DNA recovered from the precipitated chromatin was sequenced on the Illumina (Solexa) sequencing platform and mapped to the genome using the Eland alignment program. ChIP-seq data was scored based on sequence reads (length ~30 bps) that align uniquely to the human genome. From the mapped tags a signal map of ChIP DNA fragments (average fragment length ~ 200 bp) was constructed where the signal height is the number of overlapping fragments at each nucleotide position in the genome.For each 1 Mb segment of each chromosome a peak height threshold was determined by requiring a false discovery rate <= 0.05 when comparing the number of peaks above threshold as compared the number obtained from multiple simulations of a random null background with the same number of mapped reads (also accounting for the fraction of mapable bases for sequence tags in that 1 Mb segment). The number of mapped tags in a putative binding region is compared to the normalized (normalized by correlating tag counts in genomic 10 kb windows) number of mapped tags in the same region from an input DNA control. Using a binomial test, only regions that have a p-value <= 0.05 are considered to be significantly enriched compared to the input DNA control

Barb's answers are as follows:
0. B-lymphocyte, lymphoblastoid
1. B-lymphocyte
2. N/A (the record does not provide enough information to infer the organ of origin)
3. N/A (the record does not provide enough information to infer the more detailed location within the organ of origin)
4. N/A (no genetic modifications are mentioned)
5. No
6. Yes, "B-lymphocyte" appears in the sample name
7. sc-372. NFKB. Santa Cruz Biotech
8. manufacturer=santa_cruz,clone=N/A,catalog=sc-372,lot=N/A,target=NFKB
9. NFkB (NFKB, NF-kappa-B p65, NFkB p65), TNFa
10. The ChIP target is identified based on the antibody target information provided in the record by "Other antibody info: sc-372. NFKB. Santa Cruz Biotech". "sc-372" is the antibody catalogue number from manufacturer "Santa Cruz Biotech", leaving "NFKB" as the target. This is also confirmed by "NFKB IgG-rab" in the sample name. More specifically, the record indicates that it is the p65 subunit of NFKB that is targeted: "Epitope mapping at the C-terminus of NF-kappa-B p65". Overall, this indicates that the ChIP target is p65, which Barb knows is a transcription factor with official human gene name RELA
11. NFKB p65
12. RELA
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. The protocol information mentions TNF-alpha treatment. Although not mentioned explicitly as a treatment for this sample, "TNFa" appears in the sample title. The sample was therefore likely treated with TNFÎ±. In addition, the sample information also mentions that the cell line was treated with "Epstein-Barr Virus transformed." This treatment is notable in this particular context because it may have an effect on NFKB expression and activity
15. TNF-alpha (concentration=unknown, duration=unknown), Epstein-Barr Virus transformation (concentration=N/A, duration=N/A)
16. No, this sample does not correspond to a control genetic modification or control genetic background
17. No, the two treatments received correspond to "actual" treatments rather than controls
18. "Response to TNF-alpha", "NF-kappaB signaling pathway"
19. Yes (related to inflammation)
