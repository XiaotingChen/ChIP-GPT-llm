You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: ds068 293T GFP 1.SLX-7323.A013.r. GSM1464013: ds068 293T GFP 1;  ChIP-Seq
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: FOXM1 binds directly to non-consensus sequences in the human genome
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): The Forkhead transcription factor, FOXM1, is a key regulator of the cell cycle and is over-expressed in most types of cancer. FOXM1, similar to other Forkhead (FKH) factors binds to a canonical FKH motif in vitro. However, genome-wide mapping studies in different cell lines have shown a lack of enrichment of the FKH motif at FOXM1 binding sites suggesting an alternative mode of chromatin recruitment. We have investigated the role of direct versus indirect DNA binding in FOXM1 recruitment by performing ChIP-seq with WT and DNA binding deficient FOXM1. An in vitro fluorescence polarization (FP) assay was used to identify point mutations in the DNA binding domain (DBD) of FOXM1 that inhibit binding to a FKH consensus sequence. Stable cell lines expressing either WT or DBD mutant green fluorescence protein (GFP)-tagged FOXM1 were utilized for genome-wide mapping studies comparing the distribution of the DBD mutant protein to the WT. This showed that interaction of the DBD of FOXM1 with target DNA is essential for recruitment. Moreover, analysis of protein interactome of the WT versus DBD mutant FOXM1 showed that the reduced recruitment is not due to the mutation inhibiting protein-protein interactions. This study showed that a functional DBD domain is essential for FOXM1 chromatin recruitment. Even in FOXM1 mutants that show almost complete loss of binding the protein-protein interactome and pattern of phosphorylation are largely unaffected. These results strongly support a model whereby FOXM1 is specifically recruited to chromatin through co-factor interactions by binding directly to both canonical and non-canonical DNA sequences. Overall design: 15 samples, 40 bp single-ended ChIP-Seq libraries from cell lines with antibody for FOXM1 or expressing GFP-tagged FOXM1 (GFP-FOXM1), either wild type (GFP-FOXM1 WT) and with 2 different point mutations (GFP-FOXM1-HA and GFP-FOXM1-RA respectively). FOXM1: 2 replicates, samples labelled FOXM1_GTX; FOXM1-GFP WT: 5 replicates, samples labelled GFP and WT_GFP_FOXM1; FOXM1-GFP HA: 3 replicates, samples labelled GFP_FOXM1_HA; FOXM1-GFP RA: 2 replicates, samples labelled GFP_FOXM1_RA; input libraries: 3 different inputs for the respective experiments
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). experiment 1. Cells were plated in 4 x 150 cm2 dishes (1 x 10E7 per dish), cultured overnight, and treated with doxycycline (1 μg/ml) for 24 h prior to extraction. HEK293 Flp-In cells were obtained from Invitrogen (Life Technologies Ltd) and grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% tetracycline free fetal bovine serum (Clontech) and 100 μg/ml Zeocin (Invitrogen). The Flp-In cell line was first transfected with pcDNA6/TR (Invitrogen) and selected with 5 μg/ml Blasticidine (Sigma) to generate HEK293 TetR Flp-In cells. To generate the GFP-FOXM1 stable cells lines the TetR Flp-In cells were transfected with pcDNA5FRT containing an insert coding for either WT or DNA binding domain mutated (H287A or R286A) full length FOXM1B with an N-terminal EGFP tag and a control cell line expressing only EGFP was also generated. Insertion of the FOXM1 sequence occured following co-transfection of the pOG44 recombinase plasmid (Invitrogen) and positive cells were selected with 100 μg/ml hygromycin (Invitrogen) to generate GFP-FOXM1 HEK293TetR cells. IP was carried out as described in Schmidt et al. (2009) (PMID 19275939). In brief, cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde for 10 min at RT, reaction was quenched with 1/20th volume 2.5M Glycine and cell pellets were collected after scraping plates. Nuclear lysates were prepared by lysing with LB1 (50mM Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton-X plus PI) 10 min at 4°C and LB2 (10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5M EGTA plus PI) 5 min at 4°C, followed by sonication in LB3 (10mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5M EGTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine plus PI) using a diagnode sonicator to give a fragment size of ~200-300bp. Sonicated lysate was combined with 100ul protein-A magnetic beads preloaded with either 10 ug anti-FOXM1 antibody (GeneTex (USA); cat no. GTX-1000276 and GTX102170) or 10 μl anti-GFP antibody (Abcam, Cambridge, UK; ab290) O/N at 4°C. Beads were washed X6 in RIPA buffer (50mM HEPES pH7.6, 1mM EDTA, 0.7% Na deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, 0.5M LiCl) and DNA was eluted for 16 hr at 65°C in elution buffer (50mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10mM EDTA, 1% SDS). Extracted DNA was treated with RNase A for 30 min at 37°C, followed by Proteinase K for 1 hr at 55°C, and DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and quntified by bioanalyzer and quibit. Illumina ChIP-seq kit sample prep kit was used to prepare duplicate/triplicate samples
