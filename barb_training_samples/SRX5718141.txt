You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: GSM3732640: siCtrl TEAD1 ChIPseq;  ChIP-Seq
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: De-differentiation by Adenovirus E1A Due to Inactivation of Hippo Pathway Effectors YAP and TAZ [ChIP-seq]
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Adenovirus-transformed cells have a de-differentiated phenotype. Eliminating E1A in transformed human embryonic kidney cells de-repressed ~2600 genes, generating a gene expression profile closely resembling mesenchymal stem cells (MSC). This was associated with a dramatic change in cell morphology from one with scant cytoplasm and a globular nucleus to one with increased cytoplasm, extensive actin stress fibers and actomyosin-dependent flattening against the substratum. E1A-induced histone hypoacetylation by p300/CBP at H3K27/18 was reversed. Most of the increase in H3K27/18ac was near TEAD transcription factors associated with their co-activators YAP and TAZ regulated by the Hippo pathway. E1A causes YAP/TAZ cytoplasmic sequestration. After eliminating E1A, YAP/TAZ were transported into nuclei where they associated with poised enhancers with DNA-bound TEAD4 and H3K4me1. This activation of YAP/TAZ required RHO-family GTPase signaling and caused histone acetylation by p300/CBP, chromatin remodeling, and cohesin loading to establish MSC-associated enhancers and then super-enhancers. Consistent results were also observed in rat embryo kidney cells, human fibroblasts and human respiratory tract epithelial cells. These results together with earlier studies suggest that YAP/TAZ function in a developmental check-point controlled by signaling from the actin cytoskeleton that prevents differentiation of a progenitor cell until it is in the correct cellular and tissue environment. Overall design: Examination of YAP, H3K18ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1, TEAD1, TEAD4, RAD21, chromatin accessibility and mRNA by ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq, and mRNA-seq
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell line) were maintained at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum. siRNA transfections were performed using Invitrogen RNAiMAX reverse transfection protocol. Cells were plated in antibiotic free 10% FBS DMEM containing indicated Ambion/ThermoFisher Silencer Select siRNA for a final concentration of 10nM that was pre-incubated in lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent in Opti-MEM. ChIP-seq was performed using 1x107 siRNA transfected HEK293. Cells were transfected for 1 or 4 days for H3K18ac (814) and H3K27ac (Active Motif) ChIP, 4 days for H3K4me1 (abcam), RAD21 (abcam), and 8 days for YAP (CST D8H1X), TEAD1 (BD Transduction Laboratories), and TEAD4 (Santa Cruz N-G2). For H3K18ac, H3K27ac, H3K4me1 and RAD21 ChIP-seqs cells were cross-linked for 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes at room temperature on rotator. Formaldehyde crosslinking was quenched with 0.14M glycine for 30 minutes at room temperature on rotator. Cells were washed with PBS and scraped from plates in PBS with Roche protease inhibitor cocktail. Cells were pelleted and lysed in 400uL lysis buffer (1% SDS, 50mM Tris-HCl pH8, 20mM EDTA, Roche complete protease inhibitors) and sonicated at 4°C using the Qsonica Q800R2 at 20% amplitude 10s on 30s off until DNA fragments from sheared chromatin were mostly between the sizes of mostly ~200-600 base pairs. Samples were normalized for equal amounts of DNA as measured by Qubit fluorometer in sonicated, cross-linked chromatin prior to pre-clear and IP. Up to 100uL of sonicated chromatin was diluted in 10X lysis dilution buffer (16.7 mM Tris-HCl, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2mM EDTA, 167mM NaCl) and precleared for 1h 4°C with 30uL of protein A dynabeads washed 10X lysis dilution buffer on nutator. IPs were performed O/N at 4°C on nutator with precleared chromatin and 2ug of antibody or 5uL of H3K18ac anti-rabbit sera. 50uL of protein A dynabeads were added for 4h on nutator at 4°C. Bead-immunocomplexes were washed for 5min 2X with each of the following buffers in order: wash buffer A (50mM Hepes pH 7.9, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 140mM NaCl), wash buffer B (50mM Hepes pH 7.9, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% Deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 500mM NaCl), LiCl buffer (20mM Tris-HCl pH8, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% Deoxycholate, 1mM EDTA, 250mM LiCl), TE (50mM Tris-HCl pH8, 1mM EDTA). Elution was performed in 150uL of elution buffer (50mM Tris HCl pH8, 1mM EDTA, 1% SDS) then ChIP samples and inputs (10uL of precleared chromatin lysis plus 140uL elution buffer) were reverse crosslinked O/N at 65°C. Samples were RNase A treated for 1h at 37°C and DNA was purified and extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated. DNA pellets were resuspended in 12uL of TE and measured using Qubit fluorometer. YAP, TEAD1, and TEAD4 ChIP-seqs were performed similarly with the following modifications: cells were double-crosslinked with 4mM DSG in PBS for 30min then 1% formaldehyde for 10 min, crosslinking was quenched in 500mM Tris pH7.9 for 20min and cell pellets were lysed in 1mL lysis buffer 1 (50mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 140mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 0.5% NP-40, 0.25% Triton X-100, Roche cOmplete protease inhibitors) for 10min on ice. Lysate was pelleted at 3000 rpm 5min 4°C then resuspended in 1mL lysis buffer 2 (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, Roche complete protease inhibitors) and placed on nutator 10min 4°C and pelleted as before, then resuspended in 125uL of lysis buffer 3 (10mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5mM EGTA, 0.1% Na-Deoxycholate, 0.5% N-lauroylsarcosine, Roche complete protease inhibitors) and sonicated, 2ug of antibody was used, magnetic beads were washed and blocked in 0.5% BSA in PBS. ChIP sequencing libraries were constructed from 1 ng of immunoprecipitated and input DNA using the KAPA Hyper Prep Kit from KAPA Biosystems and NEXTflex ChIP-Seq barcodes purchased from Bioo Scientific

Barb's answers are as follows:
0. HEK293
1. embryonic kidney cancer
2. kidney
3. N/A
4. The sample is an siRNA control, so no genetic modifications of not were introduced by the experimenters
5. The string "input" does not appear in the sample name "GSM3732640: siCtrl TEAD1 ChIPseq;  ChIP-Seq". The sample is not an input control
6. No, the sample name "GSM3732640: siCtrl TEAD1 ChIPseq;  ChIP-Seq" does not include an abbreviation of the cell line used
7. anti-TEF1 a.k.a. TEAD1 (31/TEF1) BD Transduction Laboratories Cat#610922
8. manufacturer=bd_transduction_laboratories,clone=31/TEF1,catalog=610922,lot=N/A,target=TEAD1
9. TEAD1 (TEF1), YAP, TAZ, TEAD4, RAD21, p300/CBP
10. The rationale for ChIP target identification for this particular sample is based on the "Antibody info" field in the sample-specific section, which is "Mouse monoclonal anti-TEF1 a.k.a. TEAD1". The sample name "GSM3732640: siCtrl TEAD1 ChIPseq" further confirms that the ChIP target is TEAD1.
11. TEAD1
12. TEAD1
13. ChIP-seq for sure (the sample name includes "ChIPseq", and the "Other info of potential relevance" section indicates that the file name is "siCtrl_TEAD1_ChIPseq")
14. The record mentions siRNA transfections (which Barb would not report here given that they were covered above), and it does not specify any other notable treatments applied specifically to this particular sample other than regular cell culture procedures. Therefore, there is no notable treatment for this sample
15. N/A
16. Yes, this sample corresponds to a control genetic modification, as indicated by the use of "Silencer Negative Control No. 2 siRNA." The genetic background/modification to which it should be compared is TEAD1 siRNA knockdown
17. No: the record does not mention any treatments other than regular cell culture or genetic treatments (this sample is an siRNA control, as indicated by "siCtrl", but this is a *genetic* treatment that Barb does not consider for this particular question)
18. N/A (the record does not provide enough information to infer low-level gene ontology terms for biological processes specific to this experiment)
19. No
