You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Male breast cancer (MBC) is rare and poorly characterized. Like the female counterpart, most MBCs are hormonally driven, but resistance to hormonal treatment is common. The pan-hormonal action of steroid hormonal receptors including Estrogen Receptor alpha (ERa), Androgen Receptor (AR), Progesterone Receptor (PR) and Glucocorticoid Receptor (GR) in this understudied tumor type remains wholly unexamined. This pioneering study reveals genomic cross-talk of steroid hormone receptor action and interplay in human tumors, here in the context of MBC, in relation to patient outcome.  Using chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with massively-parallel sequencing (ChIP-seq), we characterized human MBCs for epigenetic make-up of hormonal regulation in human tumors, revealing genome-wide chromatin binding landscapes of ERa, AR, PR and GR, along with pioneer factor FOXA1 and enhancer-enriched histone mark H3K4me1. These data were integrated with transcriptomics analyses to reveal gender-selective and genomic location-specific hormone receptor action, that are associated with survival in MBC patients. Overall design: Binding of steroid hormone receptors (ER, AR, PR, GR) together with pioneer factors (FOXA1, GATA3) and a histone mark (H3K4me1) profiled in subsets of 30 males and 8 females breast tumors, and MCF-7 by ChIP-seq (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing)
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Tissue was defrosted and crosslinked in solution A (50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 1mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, pH= 7.4) containing 2 mM DSG, incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature while rotating. After 25 minutes formaldehyde was added to 1% final and incubated another 20 minutes at room temperature with rotation. Samples were quenched by adding a surplus of 0.2M glycine, pelleted by centrifugation (5'@4000rcf 4°C), washed with cold PBS and mechanically disrupted in cold PBS using a pellet pestle (Sigma). The PicoBioruptor (Diagenode) was used for sonication. For ChIP, antibodies were used to detect ERα (sc-543, Santa Cruz), AR (sc-816, Santa Cruz), FOXA1 (sc-6554, Santa Cruz), PR (sc-7208, Santa Cruz), GR (12041S lot 3, Cell Signaling Technology) and H3K4me1 (ab8895, AbCam). Immunoprecipitated DNA was prepared for Illumina multiplex-sequencing with 10 samples per lane at 65bp single end. For steroid hormone receptor ChIPs, 5µg of antibody and 50µl dynabeads (Invitrogen) were used, for FOXA1 and H3K4me1, 4µg of antibody and 40µl magnetic beads were used. Libraries were prepared according to Illumina's instructions accompanying the DNA Sample Kit (Part# 0801-0303)

9. ERα (ERa, Estrogen Receptor alpha), AR (Androgen Receptor), PR (Progesterone Receptor), GR (Glucocorticoid Receptor), FOXA1, GATA3
10. The "Antibody info" field in the sample-specific section indicates that the ChIP target is the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In addition, "GR" is the only protein reference that appears in the sample name "GSM2797089: GR ChIP-seq MCF-7; ChIP-Seq"
11. GR
12. NR3C1 (Barb knows this is the official human gene name for the Glucocorticoid Receptor, GR)
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. The record does not mention any notable treatments applied to this particular sample other than the standard ChIP-seq protocol steps
15. N/A
