You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: GSM2711378: hct116.brwd2.833.del.brwd2;  ChIP-Seq
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: A cryptic Tudor domain links BRWD2/PHIP to COMPASS-mediated histone H3K4 methylation
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methylation is a chromatin feature enriched at gene cis-regulatory sequences such as promoters and enhancers. Here we identify an evolutionarily conserved factor, BRWD2/PHIP, which colocalizes with histone H3K4 methylation genome-wide in human cells, mouse embryonic stem cells, and Drosophila. Biochemical analysis of BRWD2 demonstrated an association with the Cullin-4–RING ubiquitin E3 ligase-4 (CRL4) complex, nucleosomes, and chromatin remodelers. BRWD2/PHIP binds directly to H3K4 methylation through a previously unidentified chromatin-binding module related to Royal Family Tudor domains, which we named the CryptoTudor domain. Using CRISPR–Cas9 genetic knockouts, we demonstrate that COMPASS H3K4 methyltransferase family members differentially regulate BRWD2/PHIP chromatin occupancy. Finally, we demonstrate that depletion of the single Drosophila homolog dBRWD3 results in altered gene expression and aberrant patterns of histone H3 Lys27 acetylation at enhancers and promoters, suggesting a cross-talk between these chromatin modifications and transcription through the BRWD protein family. Overall design: ChIP-seq/RNA-seq of various cell lines depleted for BRWD2 or COMPASS components
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Cells were cultures in DMEM containing 10% FBS. RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Life technologies). RNAse free DNaseI (Sigma) was used to eliminate DNA contamination and the treated RNA was purified with RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). Cells were fixed with 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes. After quenching and cell lysis, chromatin were sonicated using a E220 focused-ultrasonicator (Covaris). 100 µg sheared chromatin, 5 µg antibody, and 50 µl protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz) were used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated DNA were purified after washing, eluting, and reverse-croslinking and submitted for library preparation. ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the KAPA HTP Library Preparation Kit complemented with NEXTflex DNA Barcodes from Bioo Scientific. 10 ng of DNA was used as starting material for input and ip samples. Libraries were amplified using 13 cycles on the thermocycler. Post amplification libraries were size selected at 250- 450bp in length using Agencourt AMPure XP beads from Beckman Coulter. Libraries were validated using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. RNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Preparation Kit with Ribo-Depletion. Input RNA quality was validated using the Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit. 200ng-1 µg of total RNA was used as starting material. Libraries were validated using the Agilent DNA 1000 Kit

All of the information below should apply specifically to this particular sample:

Antibody info:BRWD2 833
Genotype info: NA. BRWD2-KO
Tissue info: HCT116
Other info of potential relevance: parsed primary ID = {SRX3020562}; LIBRARYSELECTION = {ChIP}; molecule-type = {genomic DNA}; file name = {hct116.brwd2.833.del.brwd2. SRR5850508. SRR5850509. SRR5850510. SRR5850511}; parsed_GSM_ID = {GSM2711378}; inferred sequence type = {ChIPSeq}; LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ChIP-Seq}; sample-type = {SRA}

Barb's answers are as follows:
0. HCT116
1. Adenocarcinoma
2. Colon
3. N/A
4. BRWD2 knockout (the "del" in the sample name indicates that the gene has been deleted, as also stated by the "Genotype info: NA. BRWD2-KO" line.)
5. No, the string "input" does not appear in the sample name "GSM2711378: hct116.brwd2.833.del.brwd2; ChIP-Seq". The sample is not an input control
6. Yes, "hct116" appears in the sample name "GSM2711378: hct116.brwd2.833.del.brwd2; ChIP-Seq"
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. PHIP (BRWD2), CRL4, COMPASS
10. The sample is a ChIP-seq experiment, as indicated by the word "ChIP-Seq" in the sample name. The ChIP target for this particular sample can be inferred from the antibody info in the sample-specific section, which states "BRWD2 833". This is consistent with the sample name "hct116.brwd2.833.del.brwd2": the "del.brwd2" in the sample name indicates a genetic knockout (KO) of brwd2, as the abbreviation "del" is commonly used for "deletion", and "brwd2" refers to the protein BRWD2
11. BRWD2
12. PHIP (Barb knows this is an official human gene name, with alias BRWD2)
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. The record does not mention any notable treatments applied to this particular sample other than the genetic modification (knockout of BRWD2)
15. N/A
16. No, this sample does not correspond to a control genetic modification or control genetic background. It is a knockout of BRWD2, as indicated by the "Genotype info: NA. BRWD2-KO" line
17. No, this sample does not correspond to a control treatment
18. "COMPASS complex", "Response to DNA damage" (based on Barb's own knowledge of the role of COMPASS in the DDR), "Cell cycle regulation" ((based on Barb's own knowledge of COMPASS)
19. Yes (based on Barb's own knowledge of the role of COMPASS in the DNA damage response)
