You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: TeloHAEC TNFa RELA rep 1 s
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: Multi-species RELA, JUN, and histone modification ChIP-seq of mammalian aortic endothelial cells before and after TNFa stimulation
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): TNFa has an evolutionary conserved role in mediating inflammation via activation of the transcription factor NF-?B. The functions of individual NF-?B binding sites are not well understood. To identify conserved and functionally important NF-?B binding sites in mammals, we performed ChIP-seq to map the genome-wide binding of RELA, JUN, and select histone modifications in primary vascular endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from the aortas of human (HAEC), mouse (MAEC) and cow (BAEC), before and after TNFa. The conserved RELA binding sites show strong epigenetic changes in response to TNFa and enrich near genes controlling vascular development and pro-inflammatory responses. Our method identifies novel modes of RELA-chromatin interactions that are conserved in mammals and shared between multiple cell-types. Particularly, genomic regions bound by RELA prior to stimulation are important responders during TNFa stimulation. We use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to validate the roles of the conserved RELA pre-bound sites near pro-inflammatory genes such as CCL2 and PLK2. Our evolutionary approach describes new aspects of mammalian NF-?B biology including its role within super-enhancers and relevance in inflammatory disorders
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Multi-species RELA, JUN, and histone modification ChIP-seq of mammalian aortic endothelial cells before and after TNFα stimulation. Protocols: Primary aortic endothelial cells (ECs) isolated from human aorta (HAECs: two 21 year old Caucasian males; a 15 year old male; and a 60 year old male), mouse aorta (MAECs: two biological replicates of C57BL/6 males pooled from multiple mice), and bovine aorta (BAEC: two biological replicates of unknown sex) were grown in cell culture. TeloHAEC described with accession CVCL_Z065 HAECs, MAECs, BAECs, and TeloHAECs (ATCC CRL-4052) were cultured at 37°C and 5% CO2 supplied with Endothelial Cell Growth Media MV2 (PromoCell) supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (PromoCell), 5 ng/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (PromoCell), 0.5 ng/ml recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor 165 (PromoCell), 10 ng/ml recombinant human basic fibroblast growth factor (PromoCell), 20 ng/ml long R3 insulin-like growth factor-1 (PromoCell), 1 μg/ml ascorbic acid (PromoCell) and 0.2 μg/ml hydrocortisone (PromoCell). All experiments were carried out before passage 9. HAECs and TeloHAECs were treated with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TNFα (Cell Applications, cat# RP1111-50), MAECs were treated with 10 ng/mL recombinant mouse TNFα (Cell Applications, cat# RP2031-20), and BAECs were treated with 10 ng/mL recombinant bovine TNFα (R&D Systems, cat# 2279-BT-025) for 45 mins in basal Endothelial Cell Growth Media MV2 (PromoCell) without supplements. The un-stimulated control samples were treated with vehicle (water). For RELA ChIP, cells were initially cross-linked in 2mM disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) in PBS under shaking conditions for 30 min followed with the 1% FA (formaldehyde) cross-linking for 10 min at room temperature. For JUN and histone modification ChIPs, cells were cross-linked in 1% FA. Cells were then lysed for nuclei isolation. The chromatin was sheared into 100-500 bp DNA fragments by sonication (Misonix Sonicator) at 27-28 Watt for 26 cycles (10 seconds ON, 1 minute OFF, 28 W). We used ~1.7 % of chromatin as input. ChIPs were performed at 4°C overnight with antibodies designed against RELA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology cat# sc-372, Abcam cat# ab7970), JUN (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, H-79 cat# sc-1694), H3K27ac (EMD Millipore cat# 05-1334), H3K4me2 (EMD Millipore cat# mp07-030), H3K4me3 (EMD Millipore cat# 17-678), H3K4me1 (Abcam cat# ab8895), and H3K27me3 (EMD Millipore cat# 07-449). The cross-links were reversed at 65°C for 16 h. Proteins and RNA were enzymatically digested and DNA was purified using phenol-chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. ChIP DNA and 220 ng of input DNA were mixed with 3 units of T4 DNA polymerase (NEBNext® DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina, #E6040L) to create blunt ends. To generate 5´-phosphates, 10 units of T4 PNK (NEBNext® DNA Library Prep Master Mix Set for Illumina, #E6040L) were added to the blunt ended DNA in NEBNext End Repair Reaction Buffer (NEB, #E6042A) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA was purified using DNA Clean and Concentrator (Zymogen, cat# D4014). To add dAMP to the 3' ends, the end-repaired DNA was mixed with Klenow Fragment (3'→5' exo-) (NEB, #E6044A) in NEBNext dA-Tailing Reaction Buffer (NEB, #E6045A) and incubated for 40 min at 37°C. The dA-tailed DNA was then purified. Illumina sequencing adapters containing uracil hairpin loop structure and 3' T overhangs (NEB, #E7337A) were ligated to the DNA by adding 150 units of Quick T4 DNA Ligase (NEB, #E6047A) in Quick Ligation Reaction Buffer (NEB, #E6048A) and incubation for 15 minutes at room temperature. Looped adapter sequences were opened by removal of uracil from hairpin structures by adding 3 units of USER enzyme (Uracil-Specific Excision Reagent) (NEB, M5505S) and incubation at 37°C for 15 min. This made DNA accessible for PCR amplification with barcoded primers for Illumina sequencing (NEB, cat# E7335L). PCR amplifications were carried out for 16 cycles [98°C 30 sec, (98°C 10 s, 65°C 30 s, 72°C 30 sec) x 17 cycles, 72°C 5 min, 4°C hold]. The amplified and barcoded library was then selected for 200-350 bp fragments using Pippin Prep (Sage Science)

RELA is the only word prefixed with "anti-" in the antibody info, and it is also the only string the refers to a plausible ChIP target; TNF-alpha refers to a treatment rather than to a target, which is made obvious by the fact that a treatment concentration is specified (putting TNF information in the "Antibody target" section was thus a small mistake made during record entry). RELA is further confirmed as the ChIP target by the sample name, in which it also appears
