You are a biologist analyzing metadata from a ChIP-seq experiment database. Your task is to extract information from a record describing a single sample that is part of a larger study. The record may contain incomplete or misorganized metadata, and it is your job to identify the protein that was targeted in the ChIP experiment and to extract information about the sample.

Sample name: GSM3165648: H510 1 input;  ChIP-Seq
Name of the broader study to which the sample belongs: POU2F3 is a master regulator of a tuft cell-like variant of small cell lung cancer [ChIP-seq]
Study abstract (applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control): Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis by high throughput sequencing Overall design: ChIP-seq data in SCLC cell lines
The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). All parental cell lines were gowring exponentially upon harvest. Cells were lentivirally infected with sgRNA for knockout. NCI-H1048 cells were cultured in HITES, NCI-H128 cells were cultured in RPMI with 20% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin. All other cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% FBS and penicillin/streptomycin or HITES,. Cell lysates were clarified from sonicated nuclei and histone-DNA complexes were isolated with antibody. Libraries were prepared using Illumina TruSeq ChIP Sample Prep kit following manufacture's protocol. Briefly, ChIP DNA was end-repaired, 3'-adenylated, and then ligated with indexed adaptor. These DNA was size selected (200-400 bp) via agarose gel electrophoresis, and PCR amplified. Final products were purified using AMPure XP beads

All of the information below should apply specifically to this particular sample:

Antibody info:none
Treatment info: exponentially growing cells with no infection
Tissue info: Small cell lung cancer
Cell line info: NCI-H510A
Other info of potential relevance: parsed primary ID = {SRX4143004}; LIBRARYSELECTION = {ChIP}; molecule-type = {genomic DNA}; file name = {H510_1_input. SRR7236759}; parsed_GSM_ID = {GSM3165648}; inferred sequence type = {ChIPSeq}; LIBRARYSTRATEGY = {ChIP-Seq}; sample-type = {SRA}

Barb's answers are as follows:
0. NCI-H510A
1. Small cell lung cancer
2. Lung
3. N/A
4. N/A (no genetic modifications are mentioned that apply to this sample)
5. Yes, the string "input" appears in the sample name "GSM3165648: H510 1 input;  ChIP-Seq". Yes, the sample is an input control
6. Yes, "H510" is an abbreviation for NCI-H510A that appears in the sample name "GSM3165648: H510 1 input;  ChIP-Seq"
7. N/A
8. N/A
9. POU2F3
10. The "Antibody info" field in the sample-specific section says "none", suggesting this may be an input control. This is confirmed by the sample name "GSM3165648: H510 1 input;  ChIP-Seq", which contains "input" and no potential ChIP target. Input control samples are used to account for background noise in ChIP-seq experiments and do not involve specific ChIP targets
11. Input
12. N/A (input)
13. ChIP-seq for sure
14. The record mentions that the parental cell lines were growing exponentially upon harvest, but there is no indication of any specific treatments applied to this particular sample
15. N/A
16. Yes, this may be a control for samples that received CRISPR/Cas9 gene knockouts. The protocol section mentions "Cells were lentivirally infected with sgRNA for knockout", but this does not appear to apply to this particular sample: no genetic modifications are mentioned for this sample, and the sample-specific "Treatment info" field says "exponentially growing cells with no infection" further confirming that the cells did not receive a lentivirus-delivered sgRNA for knockout. Specific knockouts for comparison are not listed
17. No, this sample does not correspond to a control treatment
18. "Small cell lung cancer progression"
19. No
