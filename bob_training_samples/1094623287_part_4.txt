Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

The protocol information in this paragraph applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). For HA-tag ChIP-seq, stable MCF7 cell lines were induced using 100 ng/ml doxycycline (Sigma) at 0 h, doxycycline media was refreshed at 48 h, and cells were harvested at 72 h by crosslinking in a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde. Crosslinking was stopped after 5 min by adding glycine to a final concentration of 125 mM. Crosslinked cells were washed in cold phosphate buffered saline, lysed using 1 ml low-salt IP buffer (150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 5 mM EDTA, NP-40 (0.5%), Triton X-100 (1%) containing protease inhibitors) and aliquoted at 1 × 10∧7 cells/ml. For Bisufite-seq, 2 microgram of genomic DNA was isolated using a QIAeasy DNA mini kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands) and sonicated using a Covaris to an average molecular weight of 150 bp. Achievement of the desired size range was verified by Bioanalyzer (Agilent) analysis. Fragmented DNA was repaired to generate blunt ends using the END-It kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies, Madison, WI) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Following incubation, the treated DNA was purified using AmpureX beads from Agencourt. In general, magnetic beads were employed for all nucleic acid purifications in the following protocol. Following end repair, A-tailing  was performed using the NEB dA-tailing module according to manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Adapters with a 3′ ‘T’ overhang were then ligated to the end-modified DNA. For whole genome bisulfite sequencing, modified Illumina paired-end (PE) adapters were used in which cytosine bases in the adapter are replaced with 5-methylcytosine bases. Depending on the specific application, we utilized either Early Access Methylation Adapter Oligos that do not contain barcodes, or the adapters present in later versions of the Illumina DNA Sample Preparation kits, which contain both indices and methylated cytosines. Ligation was carried out using ultrapure, rapid T4 ligase (Enzymatics, Beverly, MA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The final product was then purified with magnetic beads to yield an adapter-ligation mix. Prior to bisulfite conversion, bacteriophage lambda DNA that had been through the same library preparation protocol described above to generate adapter-ligation mixes was combined with the genomic sample adapter ligation mix at 0.5% w/w. Adapter-ligation mixes were then bisulfite converted using the Zymo DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Final modified product was purified by magnetic beads and eluted in a final volume of 20 µl. Amplification of one-half the adapter-ligated library was performed using Kapa HiFi-U Ready Mix for the following protocol: 98º 2′ ; then six cycles of 98º 30′ ′ , 65º 15′′, 72º 60′′; with a final 72º 10′ extension, in a 50 µl total volume reaction. The final library product was examined on the Agilent Bioanalyzer, then quantified using the Kapa Biosystems Library Quantification kit according to manufacturer’s instructions. Optimal concentrations to get the right cluster density were determined empirically but tended to be higher than for non-bisulfite libraries. RNA was harvested using the Qiagen RNeasy kit and Illumina libraries were made with the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. ATF plasmids were designed and stably integrated into MCF7 cells as described in (Stolzenburg et al. 2012). Stable lines were grown at 30–80% confluency in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle’s Medium (Corning, Corning, NY) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin; cells were selected using 5 µg/ml puromycin (VWR, Radnor, PA) and 200 µg/ml G418 (VWR, Radnor, PA). ATF expression was induced by treatment with media containing 1µg/ml doxycycline (VWR, Radnor, PA) at 0 h, doxycycline media was refreshed at 48 h, and cells were harvested at 72 h. ATF expression was confirmed by hemagglutinin (HA) tag western blot prior to HA ChIP-seq, histone ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analysis. 552-SKD_HC.gff. Thawing Cells:  1. Thaw vial immediately in 37º C water bath. Keep O ring above the water surface to prevent contamination. Thaw content with slight  shake until only small ice is left in vial. It usually takes 1 min.
