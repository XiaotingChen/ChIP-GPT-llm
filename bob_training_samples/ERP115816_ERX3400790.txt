Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). MDA-MB-468 (HTB-132) and cell lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). Each cell line was grown in the appropriate culture media, according to manufacturer's protocol, and kept in an incubator at 37 °C, in the presence of 5% CO2. Additional details are described in Supplementary Materials. Periodically, cells were tested for mycoplasma contamination using the PCR Mycoplasma detection kit (Applied Biological Materials). The selected cell lines were used to generate full-length ERβ-expressing experimental model, using the Clontech Lenti-X Tet-On Advanced Inducible Expression System. First, the 3xFlag-ERβ1 DNA fragment was cloned  into a pLVX-Tight-Puro vector, downstream to a tetracycline inducible promoter. The cloning procedure was performed using the Clontech In-Fusion HD Cloning Kit. Subsequently, to produce lentiviral particles expressing both rTA and Erβ1 genes,Clontech's Lenti-X Packaging Single Shots (VSV-G) were used according to manufacturer's protocol. Finally, the selected TNBC cell lines were infected first with the rtTA lentiviral particles, encoding for a a transcription factor that binds to a tightly regulated inducible promoter, after were transduced with 3xFlag-ERβ lentiviral particles and tested for the protein expression upon doxycycline (Sigma-Aldrich) induction None None Chromatin was prepared and isolated as described by Tarallo et al.

We already know from a previous sentence that the ERβ is fused to a Flag tag, and the resulting protein is under control of a doxycline inducible promoter. The citation is not relevant to the analysis. The last part of the sentence provides information about the cell line identity (MDA-MB-468) but that information is not new, and the doxycycline treatment for gene induction is also already known (we do not care about its particular concentration or duration since it is a standard treatment for gene induction), hence 6:No, 7:No. Overall this sentence does not provide new information of interest.
