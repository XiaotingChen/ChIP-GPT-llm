Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

Sentence:

Then beads were incubated with 70 μl elution buffer (0.5 % SDS, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0) containing 2 μl of Proteinase K (NEB). Beads in Elution Buffer were incubated for 1 hour at 55 °C and 8 hours at 65 °C to revert formaldehyde crosslinking, and supernatant was transferred to a new tube. Another 30 μl of elution buffer was added to the beads for 1 minute and eluates were combined and incubated with another 1 μl of Proteinase K for 1 hour at 55 °C. Finally, DNA was purified with SPRI AMPure XP beads (ratio sample:beads 1:2) or Qiagen MinElute columns; ChIP version 2 (H3K4me1, and H3K36me3 and REST): Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde in up to 1.5 ml PBS for 10 minutes at room temperature.

Sentence:
Coagulation was prevented with EDTA or heparin, peripheral blood was diluted 1:1-1:3 in PBS, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated with Lymphoprep density gradient (Axis-Shield) following manufacturer instructions. Purified cells were suspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and penicillin-streptomycin.
Bob's explanation:
This sentence describes cell isolation and suspension, which is not relevant to Bob (hence 6:No).
