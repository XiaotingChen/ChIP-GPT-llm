Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

Sentence:
Release of promoter-proximal paused RNA polymerase II (Pol II) during early elongation is a critical step in transcriptional regulation in metazoan cells.
Bob's explanation:
The sentence provides scientific background on the study (hence 1:No, 2:Yes).
Bob's answer:
1:No  2:Yes  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:
The second day, after 2 washes with RIPA-0.5, 1 wash with RIPA-0.3, 1 wash with RIPA-0, 2 washes with LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.25% NP-40, and 0,25% NaDOC, pH7.4), and 2 washes with TE buffer, bound protein-DNA complexes were resuspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH7.4) supplemented with 10 µg/ml RNase A for elution and RNA digestion, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour.
Bob's explanation:
The sentence describes protocol details of no relevance (hence 1:No) and gives no information about antibodies (hence 5:No), or cell genetic background (hence 6:No), cell treatments (hence 7:No), etc.
Bob's answer:
1:No  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:
We knocked down expression of NSD2 in B-ALL cell lines heterozygous for NSD2 EK (RS4;11, RCH-ACV, SEM).
Bob's explanation:
The sentence provides information unseen so far about gene expression manipulation and cell lines (hence 6:Yes).
Bob's answer:
1:Yes  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:Yes  7:No  ###END

Bob now analyzes *one by one* all the sentences in the text below.

Three alternative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) protocols were successfully tested in combination with ChIPmentation. These protocols use different fixation, sonication, lysis, and washing conditions, making it possible to use ChIPmentation with essentially any ChIP-grade antibody; ChIP version 1 (H3K4me3, H3K27me3): Cells were washed once with PBS and fixed with 1 % paraformaldehyde in up to 1 ml PBS for 5 minutes at room temperature. Glycine was added to stop the reaction. Cells were collected at 500 x g for 10 minutes at 4 °C and washed twice with up to 1 ml ice-cold PBS supplemented with 1 μM PMSF. The pellet was lysed in Cell Lysis Buffer (50mM HEPES/KOH pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 10 % Glycerol, 0.5 % NP-40, 0.25 % Triton X-100, 1x protease inhibitors (Sigma)) for 10 minutes on ice. Nuclei were isolated by spinning the lysed cells for 10 minutes at 1000 x g at 4 °C, the supernatant was discarded and the pellet was resuspended in Sonication Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 1mM EDTA, 0.1 % SDS) and sonicated in a 130 μl microTUBE (for up to 3 x 106 cells) on a Covaris S220 for 12 minutes until most of the fragments were 200-700 base pairs long (settings: duty cycle 2 %, peak incident power 105 Watts, cycles per burst 200). Lysates were centrifuged at full speed for 5 minutes at 4 °C and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. The lysate was diluted to 200 μl per IP to a buffer composition of 20 mM HEPES, 0.1 % SDS, 1 %Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA and incubated with an antibody against H3K4me3 (1 μg/IP, Diagenode C15410003-50) or H3K27me3 (1 μg/IP, Millipore 07-449) over night at 4 °C on a rotator.
