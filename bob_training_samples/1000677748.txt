Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

The following protocol information applies to all samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). For ChIP assays, normally, cells were fixed with 0.4% (v/v) formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. For improving the ChIP efficiency of non-DNA binding factors, double fixation was used. For double fixation with EGS (Pierce, Cat. no. 21565) and formaldehyde, cells were fixed initially with 1.5 mM EGS at room temperature for 30 min, and subsequently with 0.4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. For double fixation with DMA (Pierce, Cat. no. 20660) and formaldehyde, cells were fixed initially with 25 mM DMA at room temperature for 1 hour, and subsequently with 0.4% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. After two washes with PBS, fixed cells were resuspended in ice-cold RIPA-0.3 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.1% NaDOC, and 0.3 M NaCl, pH7.4) at the concentration of 40 million/ml, and chromatin was disrupted by sonication to the size range of 100 to 500 bp. Antibodies were diluted in RIPA-0.3, and bound to Dynabeads protein A (Life Technologies, cat. no. 10002D) by incubating at 4 °C for 3 hours. The bead-antibody complexes were washed with RIPA-0.3 twice, and then incubated with sonicated chromatin at 4 °C overnight. The second day, after 2 washes with RIPA-0.5, 1 wash with RIPA-0.3, 1 wash with RIPA-0, 2 washes with LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.25% NP-40, and 0,25% NaDOC, pH7.4), and 2 washes with TE buffer, bound protein-DNA complexes were resuspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH7.4) supplemented with 10 µg/ml RNase A for elution and RNA digestion, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour. Afterwards, proteinase K was added to the final concentration of 100 µg/ml, and 30 min later, the temperature of incubation was increased to 65 °C for decrosslinking.  After decrosslinking for 4–6 hours, DNA was purified by ChIP DNA Clean & Concentrator (Zymo Research, cat. no. D5205). RNA was extracted from cells using RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 74134) or Quick-RNA MiniPrep Kit (Zymo, R1054) by following the manufacturer’s protocol (Qiagen, cat. no. 74134). ChIP-seq libraries were constructed with 5 to 10 ng immunoprecipitated DNA. RNA-seq libraries were prepared by following a previously published strand-specific protocol. Samples were sequenced on HiSeq 2000 or 2500 by following the manufacturer's protocols.. For knockdown experiments with lentiviral shRNAs, TRC control or gene-specific shRNA was transduced into cells by spin infection. Around 15 hours after transduction, cells were washed with PBS twice, and re-suspended in fresh medium. Puromycin (2 μg/ml, final conc.) was added to the culture medium 24 hours later. Cells were harvested for ChIP or RNA extraction 3 days after puromycin selection. For flavopiridol (Sigma, cat. no. F3055) treatment of THP1 cells, flavopiridol was solubilized in DMSO and added to culture medium at 1 μM (final conc.). Meanwhile, an equal volume of DMSO was added to control cells. After 1 more hour in culture, cells were fixed for ChIP.. The human AML cell line THP1 and the human ALL cell line CCRF-CEM were grown in RPMI-160 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 2% Penicillin/Streptomycin.
