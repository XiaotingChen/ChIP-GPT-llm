Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

Sentence:

Bob's answer:
1:No  2:Yes  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:
The second day, after 2 washes with RIPA-0.5, 1 wash with RIPA-0.3, 1 wash with RIPA-0, 2 washes with LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.25% NP-40, and 0,25% NaDOC, pH7.4), and 2 washes with TE buffer, bound protein-DNA complexes were resuspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH7.4) supplemented with 10 µg/ml RNase A for elution and RNA digestion, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour.
Bob's explanation:
The sentence describes protocol details of no relevance (hence 1:No) and gives no information about antibodies (hence 5:No), or cell genetic background (hence 6:No), cell treatments (hence 7:No), etc.
Bob's answer:
1:No  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:

Bob's answer:
1:Yes  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:Yes  7:No  ###END

Bob now analyzes *one by one* all the sentences in the text below.

The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). The human MO7e and MO7e-KI AMKL cell lines were cultured in MEM- supplemented with 20% FBS, Penicillin (100U/mL)-Streptomycin (100g/mL) and 2mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), and 5 ng/ml of human GM-CSF (PeproTech). HEL cells are cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, Penicillin (100U/mL)-Streptomycin (100g/mL), 2mM L-Glutamine (Gibco). AMKL cells obtained directly from immunodeficient animals or after purification by flow cytometry were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 20% FBS, Penicillin (100U/mL)-Streptomycin (100g/mL) and 2mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), and 10 ng/ml each of human SCF, IL3, IL6, IL11, TPO, 10U/ml EPO and 5 ng/ml of GM-CSF (PeproTech).  ChIP protocol was adapted from the MagnaChIP kit protocol (Millipore). Cells (AMKL and MO7e-KI) were fixed with 1% formaldehyde, lysed with Cell Lysis and then Nuclear Lysis buffers respecting concentration of 20.106 cells per mL, and finally sonicated (30-min cycle on Covaris apparatus; KBioscience). Sheared chromatin was immunoprecipitated overnight using the following antibodies: anti-CBFA2T3 (Abcam, ab33072), anti-ERG (Santa Cruz ; SC354), anti-GATA3 (Santa Cruz ; mix 50/50 of SC268X and SC269X), anti-H3K27ac (ActiveMotif, #39133), anti-H3K4me1 (Diagenode ; #C15410037), anti-H3K4me3 (Diagenode, #C15410003), anti-H3K27me3 (Cell Signaling, #9733S) and rabbit IgG (Upstate, #12-370). 1/10 of the sheared chromatin was used as a reference (Input). Immune complex collection was realized with Protein G Sepharose (Sigma-Aldrich; P3296), 1h30 at +4C. For GFP-ChIP, GFP-Trap agarose beads were used (Chromotek). Rinses were done according to MagnaChIP kit protocol with Low salt, High salt and LiCL immune complex wash buffers. Finally, elution was realized according the IPure Kit protocol (Diagenode, Cat No C03010012) following manufacturers instructions.
