Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

Sentence:

Bob's answer:
1:No  2:Yes  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:
The second day, after 2 washes with RIPA-0.5, 1 wash with RIPA-0.3, 1 wash with RIPA-0, 2 washes with LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.25% NP-40, and 0,25% NaDOC, pH7.4), and 2 washes with TE buffer, bound protein-DNA complexes were resuspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH7.4) supplemented with 10 µg/ml RNase A for elution and RNA digestion, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour.
Bob's explanation:
The sentence describes protocol details of no relevance (hence 1:No) and gives no information about antibodies (hence 5:No), or cell genetic background (hence 6:No), cell treatments (hence 7:No), etc.
Bob's answer:
1:No  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:

Bob's answer:
1:Yes  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:Yes  7:No  ###END

Bob now analyzes *one by one* all the sentences in the text below.

The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). The tissue was collected fresh and sterile from the operating room and transported on ice to the pathologist in the absence of formalin fixative. Following pathological examination, tissue in excess of diagnostic requirements was collected and subsequently de-identified at the tissue bank. The tissue was then transported on ice to the laboratory. Samples that were collected in the evening were stored in media at 4C overnight. The duration from surgery to the commencement of tissue dissociation did not exceed 24 hrs, the majority of the samples were processed on the same day as surgery. Fragments of normal ER+ breast tissue were of insufficient cell number to utilize FACS after they were dissociated as described above, so epithelial cell enrichment was performed by utilizing magnetic EasySEP EpCAM beads (StemCell Technologies). Once the cells were washed in cold PBS, the appropriate amount of selection media and magnetic particles was added and incubated on ice for 15 minutes. Next, the tube was placed on the magnet at room temperature for five minutes and eluted with chilled media and this process was repeated for a total of four times to enrich for the ER+/EpCAM+ epithelial tumor cells. Immuno-labelling of normal cells was performed at 4C using PBS as a buffer and wash solution. Incubating the cell pellet with 0.1 mg/ml DNase, 1 mg/ml rat immunoglobulin and a 1/10 dilution of anti-CD16/CD32 receptor antibody for 10 min. was sufficient to block non-specific antibody binding. The cell suspension was then made up to a final concentration of 106 cells /40 l with dilution buffer. For primary human breast tissue, antibodies directed against human lineage markers CD31 (endothelial cells), CD45 (leukocytes) and CD235a (red blood cells) were used to prepare a Lin- cell population, and these PE-linked antibodies were negatively selected against.  Primary antibodies were added at optimized dilutions and incubated for 25 min at 4C. The suspension was then washed, filtered using 40uM tube cap filters (Falcon) and centrifuged.
