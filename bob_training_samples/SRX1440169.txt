Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

1:No  2:Yes  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:
The second day, after 2 washes with RIPA-0.5, 1 wash with RIPA-0.3, 1 wash with RIPA-0, 2 washes with LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.25% NP-40, and 0,25% NaDOC, pH7.4), and 2 washes with TE buffer, bound protein-DNA complexes were resuspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH7.4) supplemented with 10 µg/ml RNase A for elution and RNA digestion, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour.

The protocol information in this paragraph likely (but not necessarily) applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). The frozen tissues were cut and divided into 50 mg aliquots and stored in tubes at -80°C. The frozen tissues were homogenized on ice for 15–30 seconds in 500 μL 1X PBS using a tissue grinder (ACTGene, Piscataway, NJ). Tissue homogenates or cultured cells were cross-linked to final 1% formaldehyde for 10 min and quenched with 125 mM glycine for 5 min at room temperature and washed once with TBS. The pellets were resuspended in cell lysis buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 10 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The lysates were divided into two aliquots and washed with MNase digestion buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH7.5, 15 mM NaCl, 60 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2). After resuspending in 500 μL MNase digestion buffer containing a proteinase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), the lysates were incubated in the presence of 1,000 units of MNase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, Cat.# M0247S) at 37 °C for 20 min with continuous mixing in thermal mixer (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, PA). After adding the same volume of sonication buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1, 20 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 2% Triton X-100, 0.2% sodium deoxycholate), the lysates were sonicated for 15 min (30 sec on / 30 sec off) using Bioruptor Twin (UCD-400) (Diagenode, Inc., Denville, NJ) and centrifuged at 21,130 x g for 10 min. The cleared supernatant equivalent to 10–20 mg of tissue or 1–2x106 cells was incubated with 2 ug of rabbit polyclonal anti-H3K36me3 antibody (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA, Cat.# 61101) or 1.5 ug of rabbit monoclonal anti-H3K36me2 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA, Cat.#2901) on rocker overnight. After adding 30 μL protein G-magnetic beads (Life technologies, Carlsbad, CA), the reactions were incubated for 3 hours. The beads were extensively washed with ChIP buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1, 10 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), high salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.1, 10 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate), LiCl2 buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0,0.25 M LiCl2, 0.5% NP-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA), and TE buffer. Bound chromatins were eluted and reverse-crosslinked at 65°C overnight. DNAs were purified using Min-Elute PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) after the treatment of RNase A and proteinase K.For RNA-seq, total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). ChIP-seq libraries were prepared from 10 ng ChIP and input DNA using the Ovation ultralow DR Multiplex kit (NuGEN, San Carlos, CA). The ChIP-seq libraries were sequenced to 51 base pairs from both ends on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument in the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine Medical Genomics Facility.RNA-seq libraries were prepared with ovation RNA-seq system v2 kit (NuGEN) according to the manufacture’s instruction, and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument in the Mayo Clinic Center for Individualized Medicine Medical Genomics Facility. The immortalized human juvenile costal chondrocyte cell line, T/C 28a2, was cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotic solution. T/C 28a2 cells were differentiated in the DMEM medium supplemented with 5% FBS, 1% antibiotic solution, 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 10 mM β-glycerol-phosphate, and 1X Insulin-Transferrin-Selenium (ITS) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) as previously described (3).  Human primary bone cells were generated from surgical waste of bone tissues collected from the patients undergoing elective orthopedic procedures at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, MN) under IRB approved protocol (IRB# 13-005619). Bone tissues were trypsinized overnight, washed thoroughly with PBS, and minced using a scalpel. The minced tissues were incubated in Advanced MEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotic solutionat 37°C and 5% CO2. The primary osteoblasts and osteocytes were plated into new culture dishes and were cultured for 3 passages at which time they become references/control cells for primary human chondroblastomas in ChIP-seq and RNA-seq assays. sample name: hj69
