After 3 hours, beads were washed 2 times with ice-cold ChIP washing buffer (50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 500 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 % NP-40, 0.7 % Na-Deoxycholate, 1x protease inhibitors) and 1 time with ice-cold TE. The samples were then resuspended in 50 μl of ChIPmentation buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mM MgCl2, 10 % Dimethylformamide) and 1 μl of Tn5 transposase (Illumina Nextera kit) was added and incubated at 37 °C for 10 minutes. After the ChIPmentation, the reaction was stopped by adding 5 μl of 0.2 % SDS/0.5 M EDTA and incubated at 50 °C for 10 minutes.
