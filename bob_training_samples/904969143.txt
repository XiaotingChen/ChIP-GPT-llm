Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

Sentence:

Bob now analyzes *one by one* all the sentences in the text below.

The protocol information in this paragraph applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). 8-10 million cells ectopically overexpressing different V5-tagged FOXA1 variants and WT AR (or TLE3) were fractionated to isolated intact nuclei using the NE-PER kit reagents (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat#: 78835) and lysed in the complete IP lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat#: 87788). Nuclear lysates were incubated for 2 hours at 4C with 30ul of magnetic Protein-G Dynabeads (Thermo Fisher Scientific; Cat#: 10004D) for pre-clearing. A fraction of the cleared lysate was saved as input and the remainder was incubated overnight (12-16 hours) with 10ug of target protein antibody at 4C with gentle mixing. Next day, 50ul of Dynabeads Protein-G beads were added to the lysate-antibody mixture and incubated for 2h at 4C. Beads were washed 3 times with IP buffer (150nM NaCl; Thermo Fisher Scientific) and directly boiled in 1X NuPage LDS/reducing agent buffer (ThermoFisher Scientific; Cat#: NP0007 and NP0009) to elute and denature the precipitated proteins. These samples were then immunoblotted as described above with the exception of using protein A-HRP secondary (GE HealthCare, Cat#: NA9120-1ML) antibody for detection. The ChIP-seq sample preparation for sequencing was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Illumina). ChIP-enriched DNA samples (1-10 ng) were converted to blunt-ended fragments using T4 DNA polymerase, E.coli DNA polymerase I large fragment (Klenow polymerase) and T4 polynuleotide kinase (New England BioLabs, NEB). A single A-base was added to fragment ends by Klenow fragment (3' to 5' exo minus; NEB) followed by ligation of Illumina adaptors (Quick ligase, NEB). The adaptor-modified DNA fragments were enriched by PCR using the Illumina Barcode primers and Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB). PCR products were size selected using 3% NuSieve agarose gels (Lonza) followed by gel extraction using QIAEX II reagents (QIAGEN). Libraries were quantified with the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 Sequencer (100 nucleotide read length). Cells were seeded in a 6-wells plate at 200,000 cells/well density and transiently transfected with 2.5ug of lentiCRISPR-V2 (Addgene: #52961) vector using the Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Cat#: L3000008), encoding the Cas9 protein and sgRNA that cuts either at amino acid 271 (5’-GTCAAGTGCGAGAAGCAGCCG-3’) or 359 (5’-GCCGGGCCCGGAGCTTATGGG-3’) in Exon2 of FOXA1. Cells were treated with non-targeting control sgRNA (5’-GACCGGAACGATCTCGCGTA-3’) vector to generate isogenic WT clones. Transfected cells were selected with puromycin (Gibco) for 3-4 days and FACS-sorted as single cells into 96-well plates. Cells were maintained in 96-wells for 4-6 weeks with replacement of the growth medium every 7days to allow for the expansion of clonal lines. Clones that successfully seeded, were further expanded and genotyped for FOXA1 using Sanger sequencing and immunoblotting with the N-terminal FOXA1 antibody. Sequence and expression validated 22RV1 and LNCaP clones with distinct class2 mutations were used for growth, invasion and metastasis assays as described. To generate stable cells, doxycyclline-inducible vectors coding different FOXA1 variants or GFP (control) were packaged into viral particle through the University of Michigan Vector Core. PCa cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at 100,000-250,000cells/well density and infected with 0.5ml of 10X viral titres packaged at the UofM Vector Core. This was followed by 3-4 days of puromycin (Gibco) selection to generate stable lines. SI_16484. Most cell lines were originally purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and were cultured as per the standard ATCC protocols. LNCaP-AR and LAPC4 cells were gifts from Dr. Charles Sawyers lab (Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY). Until otherwise stated, for all the experiments LNCaP, PNT2, LNCaP-AR, C42B, 22RV1, DU145, PC3 cells were grown in the RPMI 1640 medium (Gibco) and VCaP cells in the DMEM with Glutamax (Gibco) medium supplemented with 10% Full Bovine Serum (FBS; Invitrogen). LAPC4 cells were grown in IMEM (Gibco) medium supplemented with 15%FBS and 1nM of R1881. Immortalized normal prostate cells: RWPE1 were grown in keratinocyte media with regular supplements (Lonza); PNT2 were grown in RPMI medium with 10%FBS. HEK293 cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) medium with 10% FBS. All cells were grown in a humidified 5%CO2 incubator at 37℃. All cell lines were biweekly tested to be free of mycoplasma contamination and genotyped every month at the University of Michigan Sequencing Core using Profiler Plus (Applied Biosystems) and compared with corresponding short tandem repeat (STR) profiles in the ATCC database to authenticate their identity in culture between passages and experiments
