Bob is an expert biologist analyzing sentences taken from a sequencing database record describing a ChIP-seq experiment. Bob's purpose is to distinguish sentences that contain information about ChIP targets, cells processed, or treatments applied to those cells from sentences that he's not interested in. This will help downstream text analysis to be performed in the future. Bob is not interested in fine technical detail, as his purpose is not to reproduce the experiments or to optimize them. Bob is also not **at all** interested in the technical aspect of the ChIP protocol; he does not care about general cell maintenance procedures, cell fixation or fixatives, crosslinking, washing, resuspension, elution, shearing, sonication, precipitation, library preparation protocols, sequencing protocols, sequencing platforms, or downstream analysis programs etc. To perform his task, Bob outputs a numbered list of Yes/No answers about each sentence:
1. Is this sentence of interest to Bob?
2. Does it correspond to scientific background of the study, or to interpretation of its results?
3. Does it contain a file name with substrings (possibly abbreviated) that refer to sample-specific antibodies or their targets, cell line names, drugs, or treatment conditions? For example, "Yes" for "GSM2423903_HEK293_FLP_BRCA1_Empty_V5_GRCh38.bigWig", which refers to "HEK293" cells, the "FLP" recombinase, the "BRCA1" gene, the "V5" tag, and the "Empty [vector]" condition, but "No" for "GSM2423903_ENCFF471MBU_signal_p-value_GRCh38.bigWig" which only has GEO/SRA/Encode sample IDs.
4. Does it pertain solely to metadata such as the date of the experiment, the institution or researcher who conducted the experiment, data availability or publication status, or file names with numeric IDs, etc. ?
5. Does it mention the specific antibodies used for immunoprecipitation, their catalogue numbers or manufacturers, or how they were raised?
6. Does it add **new** information (not already included in preceding sentences) about the cell line, tissue, or organ used for ChIP, or about the gene expression, overexpression or silencing status, or vectors the cells may contain?
7. Does it mention "interesting" cell treatments including e.g. drug treatments, application of stress or stimuli, or drugs to induce expression? Bob is not interested in regular cell culture techniques or cell preparation for ChIP.

Bob provides concise, professional, insightful, helpful, and truthful explanations for his answers -- as shown in the following examples.

Sentence:

Bob's explanation:
The sentence provides scientific background on the study (hence 1:No, 2:Yes).
Bob's answer:
1:No  2:Yes  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:
The second day, after 2 washes with RIPA-0.5, 1 wash with RIPA-0.3, 1 wash with RIPA-0, 2 washes with LiCl buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.25 M LiCl, 0.25% NP-40, and 0,25% NaDOC, pH7.4), and 2 washes with TE buffer, bound protein-DNA complexes were resuspended in elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1mM EDTA, and 1% SDS, pH7.4) supplemented with 10 µg/ml RNase A for elution and RNA digestion, and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour.
Bob's explanation:
The sentence describes protocol details of no relevance (hence 1:No) and gives no information about antibodies (hence 5:No), or cell genetic background (hence 6:No), cell treatments (hence 7:No), etc.
Bob's answer:
1:No  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:No  7:No  ###END

Sentence:

Bob's answer:
1:Yes  2:No  3:No  4:No  5:No  6:Yes  7:No  ###END

Bob now analyzes *one by one* all the sentences in the text below.
```
The protocol information in this paragraph applies to **all** samples in the study, not just the present sample; each sample may have been processed with its own specific set of antibodies, or may be a control (see abstract). Cells were first crosslinked by formaldehyde, then sonicated in SDS containing buffer to dissolve the chromatin. The clarified chromatin were immunoprecipitated with dyno beas conjucated with antibodies. For ORC1 ChIP, the chromatin were  immunoprecipitated with streptavidin dyno beads( Invitrogent, M280). For native ChIP-seq, cells were collected and digested by MNase to get the mono-nucleosome. For BrdU-IP-seq, genomic DNA were extracted from cells and then sonicated to 200-500bp. The ChIP-seq antibodies are as following: Anti-H2A.Z, Abcam, ab4174; Anti-BrdU, BD, BD44; Anti-H4K20me1, Abcam, ab9051; Anti-H4K20me2, Abcam, ab9052; Anti-H4K20me3, Abcam, ab9053. H2A.Z, H4K20me, ORC1,BrdU Libraries(sample 1-22, 35-44, 49-52) were prepared according to NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (E7370L) and were sequenced using HiSeq2000 or Nova seq. Cells were transfected with siRNA oligos by lipo2000. Active CD4+ T cells were induced by by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 for 72h from naïve CD4+ T cells of H2A.Zf/f and CD4creH2A.Zf/f mice. BrdU.  SI.S50.bw. Hela cells were cultured in medium with 90% DMEM, 10%FBS, 1% Pen/Strep in standard incubator with 5% CO2 at 37°C

Bob's explanation:
The sentence mentions ChIP targets (H2A.Z, H4K20me, ORC1, and BrdU) but all of those targets were mentioned in preceding senetences and the sentence only adds new technical details about library preparation and sequencing, which Bob is not interested in (hence 1:No).
